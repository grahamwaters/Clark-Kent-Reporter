The sections are extracted using the regular expression r'^#.*\\n([\\s\\S]*?)^#', which matches lines that start with a # character followed by anything else, followed by a newline, capturing everything else until the next line that starts with a # character. Finally, the code blocks are extracted using the regular expression `r'(.+?)', which matches blocks of text that are surrounded by triple backtick characters (```), capturing everything inside the backticks.\n",
